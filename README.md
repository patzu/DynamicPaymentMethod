🚀 **Building a Dynamic Payment Processing System with Spring Boot and Factory Pattern**

**Introduction**
📝 _Overview_: In this tutorial, we'll dive into building a flexible payment processing system using Spring Boot and the Factory Pattern. The system will support multiple payment methods, allowing users to select their preferred payment option.

**Problem Statement**
💡 _Challenge_: Implementing a payment processing system that can adapt to various payment methods seamlessly. We aim to create an extensible solution that accommodates future additions of new payment methods without altering the existing codebase.

**Setting Up the Project**
🔧 _Initialization_: We'll start by initializing a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr. Dependencies for Web, Spring Security, and other required components will be added. The project structure will be configured for easy management.

**Defining the Payment Interface**
📑 _Contract_: We'll define a Payment interface that serves as the contract for all payment methods. This interface will include methods such as `processPayment()` to handle payment transactions.

**Implementing Payment Methods**
🛠️ _Concrete Implementations_: Concrete implementations of the Payment interface, such as CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment, will be created. Each implementation will define its logic for processing payments.

**Implementing the Payment Factory**
🏭 _Dynamic Creation_: A PaymentFactory class will be developed to instantiate the appropriate Payment implementation based on user input. The factory will provide a method to return the specific Payment implementation based on the requested payment type.

**Configuring Spring Beans**
🌱 _Bean Configuration_: Spring beans for each Payment implementation will be defined in the application context. Additionally, the PaymentFactory bean will be configured for dependency injection wherever dynamic payment processing is required.

**Creating Endpoint Controllers**
🎮 _Request Handling_: Endpoint controllers will be implemented to handle different payment requests. Controller methods will be defined to map to specific endpoints (e.g., /payment/creditcard, /payment/paypal). The PaymentFactory bean will be injected into the controllers to dynamically select the appropriate payment method.

**Testing the Application**
🧪 _Validation_: The Spring Boot application will be started, and tools like Postman or curl will be used to send requests to the defined endpoints with different payment types. We'll verify that the application processes payments correctly based on the selected payment method.

**Conclusion**
🔍 _Summary_: This tutorial provides a comprehensive guide to building a Dynamic Payment Processing System using Spring Boot and the Factory Pattern. Users can select different payment methods via HTTP requests to the application endpoints, offering flexibility and extensibility.
